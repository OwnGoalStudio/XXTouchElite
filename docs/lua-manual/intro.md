# Intro

## How to Read This Manual

- Reference [Lua 5.3 Reference Manual](https://cloudwu.github.io/lua53doc/manual.html).
- Optional parameters in parameter descriptions are enclosed in square brackets.
- Parameters or return values that are fixed structured table values are represented using curly braces.
- In type descriptions, both *text* and *string* are Lua's `string` type, but *text* generally refers to UTF-8 encoded, printable plain text.
- In type descriptions, *sequential table* or *list* refers to arrays in the conventional sense, and *associative table* refers to dictionaries in the conventional sense. Both belong to *table*.
- Unless otherwise specified, example code in this manual does not handle edge cases and should not be directly copied to your scripts.
